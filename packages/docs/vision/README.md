The tooling for managing knowledge digitally is limited. 

This is probably not a sentiment shared by everyone. Many users are satisfied with their existing workflow, and can't imagine the impetus to change. We doubt that there will be a solution that will be universally recognized as an improvement.

Tools for organizing thought differ in their **modal interaction**. The tools that the market has come up with have presented us with the interaction of organizing knowledge in a hierarchy. 

A phrase we make use of here is '[tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/#top)'

### Hierarchical tools for thought

**The modal interaction of Evernote or OneNote is to create a note.** But when you create a note, you've already picked a notebook and section, clearly demarcating and organizing your ideas in a hierarchy.

**The modal interaction of MindMeister is to create a new node representing an idea**, but apart from the root, your node is created either as a child of another node, or its sibling.

### Freeform tools for thought

Whiteboards let you wander on the two dimensional plane. Your ideas feel important, since space is scarce. **The modal interaction is to simply draw.**

Digitally, we're limited in how we can process your whiteboarding, and remain universal. A digital whiteboard is essentially an image (though with an added history dimension). Without understanding user intent, we're limited in what we can do.

### Linked tools for thought

This is our domain.

Existing tools here include wiki software, Twitter (post threading ~Dec 2017), and the web in general. **The (bi)modal interaction is to create content and link things.**

Our brains handle information in an [associative manner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_(psychology)). Our tools should reflect that.

We want to accomplish these goals, in this order:

- create a standard for expressing repositories of linked content.
- build the alternative 'linked tools for thought' platform for personal use.
