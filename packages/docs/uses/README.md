# Introduction

We took a look at three use cases of a platform based on the OpenMind standard. Each reveals something about the nature of the problem we're solving.

* [Research](/uses/research): The use of OpenMind for original research work, connecting ideas, and guiding people through [Idea Mazes](https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze). (connectivity of ideas)

* [Understanding Language](/uses/understanding-language): The use of the visual features of OpenMind for taking apart features of language and understanding them deeply. (Visual maps; associative memory)

* [Learning](/uses/learning) (content variety; low user friction)
